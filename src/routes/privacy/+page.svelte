        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Our Service contains links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions of every site you visit.

        <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            The security of your information is important to us. We host our Service on Vercel, which provides security measures for its infrastructure, including DDoS protection, automatic HTTPS, and compliance certifications (like SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance for their platform). However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 mt-6">6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Our Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information directly from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
        </p>
